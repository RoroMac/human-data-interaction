A jupyter python notebook for Brock Craft's HCDE 410 course: Human-Data Interaction. The Burke-Gilman commuter file performs a basic data analysis about traffic along the trail from an API call. The data retrieved identifies: time (year-month-day: hour-minute-seconds), direction (northbound-southbound), bikers, and pedestrians. It then uses dictionaries and lists to determine frequency of use across various time intervals. The bg_traffic_bike_ped_2019.csv is created in this file. It contains hour of the day, cummulated northbound bikers on the trail during 2019, cummulated southbound bikers, cummulated northbound pedestrians, and cummulated southbound pedestrians.

The SODA_API_demo examines various API calls using Seattle permit data. It creates a .csv file containing 1000 most recent residential building permits containing information such as; permit number, description, building type, and completed date.
