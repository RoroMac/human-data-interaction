    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Out of all of Washington state’s (not the university) employees, the highest paid are head coaches employed at [public institutions](https://fiscal.wa.gov/Salaries.aspx). These salaries range from 1-3 million per year, exceeding even the university president. This isn’t unique to Washington-based universities. The 20 most well paid state employees of California are [head coaches belonging to basketball or football](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://transparentcalifornia.com/salaries/all/&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1651889083939114&usg=AOvVaw2dypMm6Sq2xGeZNk4dSH_Z). It’s commonly defended that these people are paid more because of their positive impact in generating profit for the university. The reality is that very few athletic departments have a [net positive revenue](https://www.bestcolleges.com/news/analysis/2020/11/20/do-college-sports-make-money/). Another argument is that athletic wins impact the number of university applicants. And while this was identified to be [true in 2009](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/23780052_The_Impact_of_College_Sports_Success_on_the_Quantity_and_Quality_of_Student_Applications#:~:text=Key%20findings%20include%20the%20following,in%20application%20rates%20after%20sports), it’s unsure whether this trend holds up 12 years later."

    "In 2018, the Atlantic published an article, [College Sports Are Affirmative Action for Rich White Students](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/college-sports-benefits-white-students/573688/). Despite a rich diversity of high profile collegiate sports like Football and Basketball, the overwhelming majority of student athletes tend to be white. Statistics are reported to challenge particular beliefs and identify curious relationships. One interesting finding is that 65% of student athletes in the NCAA are white. Another is that athleticism stifle Asian mens' chances at Harvard during the admission process. And that a majority of student athletes have incomes of $250,000 with many sports associated with country-club like activities such as Sailing, lacrosse, and ice-hockey with less than 10% of black student athletes across the all NCAA teams.\n",

    "Another 2017 article, [The March Madness Application bump](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/03/the-march-madness-application-bump/519846/), discusses the impact that March Madness has on number of applications a university receives. Cinderalla teams, are perceived underdog universities that after beating larger rivals, gain an increase in popularity. While the number of applicants increases, there was a finding that the SAT scores are weighted to be slightly lower. As  students apply to multiple colleges, sports could impact the selection of fall-back schools.\n",

    "My original idea was about university financial transparency and Washington state employee salary data. The feedback given by my peers was about how I was defining transparency and what conclusions I could get from salary data. Instead of focusing on individual salaries as university transparency, looking at school-wide data instead. Instead of asking how a state employee can have a salary of 3-million, I could focus on a more quantifiable, do sports have a significant impact on the university?"
